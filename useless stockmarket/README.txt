USELESS STOCK MARKET DOCUMENTATION

1. The index.html page is the main page that has listed stocks and a menu option, and a reset button to clear site data stored in the local storage

2. script.js is the scriping for the main index. its contains the code for the price fluctuations, local storage, reset option.

3. stock1.html-stock5.html contains graphs of the listed stocks

4. graph.js has the graphing script which uses chart.js library and is used by stock1.html-stock5.html

5. Apart from these. there is a bribe section which satirically does nothing but displays a static page with fraud warning

6. and there is an about section, that explains what the page is for.
